### What I learned

This project was a great learning experience, especially as I'm currently enrolled in a web development course. One of the key skills I developed during this challenge was setting up a simple React context, which allowed me to efficiently manage and share state across different components.

Additionally, I adopted a mobile-first approach to design and development, ensuring that the site is optimized for smaller screens before scaling up to larger devices. This approach not only improved the responsiveness of the site but also helped streamline the overall development process.


### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to explore and improve on several areas:

- **Deepening my understanding of React Context:** While I set up a basic context in this project, I aim to push this further by managing more complex state and exploring advanced patterns in context usage.
- **Experimenting with TypeScript:** I'm interested in learning TypeScript to enhance the type safety of my React applications and reduce bugs by catching errors at compile time.
- **Trying out Tailwind CSS:** I plan to explore Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, leveraging its utility-first approach to style components efficiently.
- **Overall improvement in React skills:** I want to continue honing my React skills, particularly in areas such as performance optimization, hooks, and component architecture.

By focusing on these areas, I hope to enhance the robustness and scalability of my future projects.
